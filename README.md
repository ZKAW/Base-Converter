# Base converter
A python script to convert any base to any base.  
**This script use native modules ***BUT*** it doesn't use native functions.
It means that it uses a mathematical approach to convert.**

## How to download:

* `git clone https://github.com/ZKAW/base-to-base-converter`

## Installation:

* Doesn't need any additional packages, works with native modules

## Usage:

* `python3 base_converter.py`  
  
 -> You will be prompted for the number or letter to convert,  
    Then for the input base (in which base the number to convert is),  
    And, for the output base (in which base the number should be converted).

or

* `python3 base_converter.py <number or letter to convert> <input_base> <output_base>`  
  
 -> For a command line arguments usage.  
    Exemple: `python3 base_converter.py 1100 2 10` -> Output will be 12  
    Exemple: `python3 base_converter.py B 16 10` -> Output will be 11
